With physics object prepared and NanoAOD files created, we are ready to begin thinking about an actual
physics analysis!

In the previous exercises, you learned how to access and store object information from an AOD file and convert the AOD file to NanoAOD.
The `Events` tree within the NanoAOD files contains all the derived information required for many searches or measurements. We will study
a search for the Higgs boson in the tau tau decay channel -- you can go back to the pre-exercises to find the published paper.
